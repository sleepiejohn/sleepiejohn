### Be welcomed to my goofy self presentation.

I'm developer doing business systems to help workers more productive in their ðŸ“‹ tasks and managers more insightful about companies ðŸ“Š metrics!

I have been practicing topics such as full stack development, dabbing into machine learning and now learning more about distributed systems more
specifically fault resilience and tolerance ðŸ’¥

If these topics interest you too get in touch! I will be happy to learn more from you!
